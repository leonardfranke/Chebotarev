 abstract = {We are concerned with solving polynomial equations over rings. More precisely, given a commutative domain A with 1 and a polynomial equation an tn + . . . + a₀ = 0 with coefficients ai in A, our problem is to find its roots in A. We show that when A = B[x] is a polynomial ring, our problem can be reduced to solving a finite sequence of polynomial equations over B. As an application of this reduction, we obtain a finite algorithm for solving a polynomial equation over A when A is F[x₁, . . . , xN] or F(x₁, . . . , xN) for any finite field F and any number N of variables. The case of quadratic equations in characteristic two is studied in detail.},

abstract = {Let p be a prime number and let Vp be the Vandermonde matrix with (i,j)-entry equal to ωij for 0≤i,j≤p−1, where ω is a primitive pth root of unity in the complex field. The classical Chebotarëv theorem says that all square submatrices of Vp have nonzero determinant. In this paper, we establish the Chebotarëv theorem over finite fields by imposing certain conditions.}
